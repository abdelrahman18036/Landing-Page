## Instructions

You will need to translate this project from a static project into an interactive. You will need to modify HTML and CSS files but especially the JavaScript file. The initial project will have HTML and CSS files to display a static version of the landing page project.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the
Udacity Classroom.

## Development

To run this project locally, in your development folder, run
`npx http-server -c-1 -o` to run a local development server with no-cache
enabled and automatically opening your standard browser. Make some changes and
reload the browser and the changes are applied.

Enjoy!

## ES6

I have used a range of ES6 methods and javascript and browser features that only the new modern browsers deliver, for example' IntersectionObserver.'
Although they work with recent browsers except for IE 11, IE10 and Opera mini / mobile.

The majority of modifications occurred to the' js / app.js' file and some styling changes to `style.css`

## Done

In an unordered list and scrolling in the section this project has now been improved with the dynamic generated navigation list.
